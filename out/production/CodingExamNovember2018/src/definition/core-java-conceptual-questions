jdk contains javac, which compiles java soure code. we also java tool which executes the bytecode from the java compiler.
we also have jar tool which contains classes and methods that accomplish a specific task

What is IDE?
A. IDE stands for integrated development environment. it is here that we write our java source code

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. Some popular ones include eclipse,intellij and netbeans.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. We start with our source code in IDE. this gets converted to bytecode by the java compiler.
then the byte code is loaded into memory by the class loader and executed by the jvm into machine code

what is class?
A. A class is a blueprint of the states and behaviors of a certain type of model

What is object?

classes can implement many interfaces, but only one abstract class

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. oop stands for object oriented programming. all java applications are based on the concept of objects.
there are oop concepts:
inheritence: this is when a class has access to the members of its parent without having to be reimplemented.
polymorhism: this is when a class can change the methods of its parents class to fit its specific needs as well as add its own members
encapsulation: this is when we restrict the scope of certain members so that they cannot be manipulated outside of the class where they
are defined, this is achieved with the "private keyword";
abstraction: abstraction is the process of implentation hiding. we use it when we want certain features to be implemented but we dont care
how it is implemented

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. a package is simply a folder or directory that stores related files and applications for easy access and readability
The default package is an unnamed package. The unnamed package contains java classes whose source files did not contain a package declaration.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. API stands for Application programming interface, it is essentially a service that we use to communicate one computer
with another. We have used the instagram api, the google maps api, the calender api

as many interfaces as we want.
